## Executive Summary: 

### The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness. The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll and scores are based on answers to the main life evaluation question asked in the poll. This question, known as the Cantril ladder, asks respondents to think of a ladder with the best possible life for them being a 10 and the worst possible life being a 0 and to rate their own current lives on that scale. The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors – economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity.

### I chose this data set because in addition to meeting the project requirements of continuous variables, categorical variables, and geographic data, I was intrigued to explore this because it is a global analysis quantifying a subjective subject, happiness.
